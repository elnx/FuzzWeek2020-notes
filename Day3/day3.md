## Building a RISC-V toolchain
* Building a riscv-gnu-toolchain
  * Link: github.com/riscv/riscv-gnu-toolchain
  * Base (RV32i/64i) Integer Instruction Set (all others are extensions)
    * RISC-V does not come out of the box with MUL and DIV (this is an extension)
    * Same for atomic operations (both 32 and 64 bit) and float operations
  * Most people use RV64G
    * Base with MUL/DIV, atomic, single and double precision float
* Get source
* Get prereqs
* Build the linux toolchain
  * Breaks because needs A extension (atomics)
  * Instead, build against newlib
    * `./configure --prefix=/opt/rv64i-newlib ...`

## Newlib (Red Hat newlib C Library)
* Very simplified with minimal number of instructions
  * Simplicity -> can use almost as an intermediate language
* "libc binding sort of thing with a reduced set of syscalls"
  * Developed for embedded devices


## Code stuff
* Edited emulator and fuzzer to work with newlib riscv toolchain
  * New syscall handling
* Need to rebuild target (objdump from binutils) for newlib
* `/opt/rv64i-newlibbin/riscv64-unknown-elf-gcc -W -Wall -Wstrict-prototypes -Wmissing-prototypes -g -O2 -o objdump objdump.o budemang.o prdbg.o rddbg.o debug.o stabs.o ieee.o rdcoff.o bucomm.o version.o filemode.o .../opcodes/.libs/libopcodes.a ../bfd/.libs/libbfd.a ../libiberty/libiberty.a ./..intl/libintl.a`
  * from inside `binutils-2.14/`
* No more kernel bottleneck, but there is a memory leak somewhere...
  * 4.6bil instructions per second
  * 5600 fuzz cases per second
  * 4.6bil instructions per second is (?) very slow; can do much better with JIT
* Currently, emulated with byte-level permission checks
  * Emulator has no caching -- the same instruction is decoded every time

## JIT
* Need to implement RWX memory
  * Taking from another `gamozolabs` project --- `vectorized_mmu` on github
  * function `alloc_rwx`
* Need access to Mmu: 
  * Registers
  * Mmu perms vector
  * Memory vector
  * Dirty vector
  * Dirty bitmap
* Will be literally invoking NASM in commandline instead of using bindings
* Arch
  * JIT blocks
  * When executing something, check if executed before
    * If not executed before, will read instructions and emit code until we encounter the
      first branch.
    * Make block
    * Write it to cache
    * Cat to file
    * Dump to JIT buffer
    * Register in lookup table that converts target address to JIT address that is usable by the JIT
* Make `jitcache.rs` file
  * Contains struct `JitCache`: a cache which stores cached JIT blocks and translation tables to them
